                    I'm Rajdeep Samanta, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Techno India University.  
                    I'm an enthusiastic learner with hands-on experience in developing full-stack web applications and implementing real-world projects.<br />
                    I have a solid grasp of <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong> and actively work on improving my problem-solving skills through competitive programming.  
                    My true passion lies in <strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong>, where I combine logical thinking with creativity to build impactful and scalable solutions.<br />
                    I primarily work with <strong>Java</strong> and modern web technologies, and I have practical experience with the <strong>MERN stack</strong> â€” using React.js for frontend, Node.js and Express.js for backend, and MongoDB for database management.<br />
                    I'm always curious to explore new technologies and frameworks, and I believe in continuously learning to grow as a developer.  
                    Beyond coding, I also have a strong interest in the <strong>Finance domain</strong>, and I enjoy understanding how tech can transform industries.<br />
                    As a passionate developer based in India, I aim to deliver meaningful digital experiences that merge functionality with user-centric design.
